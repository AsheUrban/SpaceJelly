## Three.js Particles Tutorial

I made this 2.5 hours long tutorial on particles in Three.js. We'll create the stars effect, and then we'll add the 3D model of the planet Saturn to complete the scene.
The project will be created from scratch and it's easy to follow for beginners.

```

### Set Up and Run Project

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to this project's production directory.
3. Within the production directory create a new file called `appsettings.json`.
4. Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code, replacing the `uid` and `pwd` values with your own username and password for MySQL. For the LearnHowToProgram.com lessons, we always assume the `uid` is `[your-username]` and the `pwd` is `[your-password]`.

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*", 
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=Space_api;uid=[YOUR-USERNAME];pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD];"
