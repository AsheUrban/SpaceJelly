## Three.js Particles Tutorial

I made this 2.5 hours long tutorial on particles in Three.js. We'll create the stars effect, and then we'll add the 3D model of the planet Saturn to complete the scene.
The project will be created from scratch and it's easy to follow for beginners.

* GitHub

## Goals/Objectives

This project shows how to connect an ASP.NET Core MVC project to a MySQL database using [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/).

## Description

This project showcases the particle movement in an npm package library, Three.js, additionally installed in the node package manager (npm).


## How To Run This Project

If you have not already, install the `npm` tool by running the following command in your terminal:

``` bash
$ npm install 
$ npm install three
```

### Set Up and Run Project

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to this project's production directory.
3. Within the production directory create a new file called `appsettings.json`.
4. Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code, replacing the `uid` and `pwd` values with your own username and password for MySQL. For the LearnHowToProgram.com lessons, we always assume the `uid` is `[your-username]` and the `pwd` is `[your-password]`.

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*", 
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=Space_api;uid=[YOUR-USERNAME];pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD];"
  }
}

```
